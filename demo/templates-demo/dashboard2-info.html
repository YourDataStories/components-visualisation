    <p class="text-justify">YourDataStories looks at ODA broken down into individual “<a href="http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/#iri=http://platform.yourdatastories.eu/api/json-ld/model/owl/AidActivity.owl" target="_blank">Aid Activities</a>”. An Aid Activity has</p>
    <ul>
        <li>one or more benefactor and beneficiary countries,</li>
        <li>a duration or date range,</li>
        <li>organisations involved in its implementation,</li>
        <li>a thematic sector (e.g., humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, water supply), and</li>
        <li>a set of financial transactions (such as “<a href="http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/#iri=http://platform.yourdatastories.eu/api/json-ld/model/owl/DisbursedItem.owl" target="_blank">Disbursement</a>”
            a.k.a. actual payment, or “<a href="http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/#iri=http://platform.yourdatastories.eu/api/json-ld/model/owl/CommittedItem.owl" target="_blank">Commitment</a>”
            a.k.a. planned payment).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: #3C75B7; margin-top: 0">YourDataStories: Modelling Trade</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">YourDataStories looks at international trade among countries broken down into individual
        “<a href="http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/#iri=http://platform.yourdatastories.eu/api/json-ld/model/owl/TradeActivity.owl" target="_blank">Trade Activities</a>”,
        which represents annual activity between two countries. A Trade Activity has</p>
    <ul>
        <li>an origin and a destination country,</li>
        <li>a financial year that the activity concerns,</li>
        <li>the amount spent,</li>
        <li>the sector it concerns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: #3C75B7">A quick overview of the Dashboard</h3>

    <p class="text-justify">After selecting an activity type, the two maps show all beneficiary (recipient) and
        benefactor (donor) countries in the case of Aid Activities, or origin and destination countries in the case of
        Trade Activities, that are available in the data, coloured according to the number of Aid or Trade Activities
        they have been involved in. Both maps are interactive, allowing the selection of any number and combination of
        countries.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">In the next step, a slider allows the selection of any time period within the available data.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">Finally, there is a set of “info boxes” that allow you to filter for various aspects
        of the ODA data. Clicking on each “info box” shows predefined visualisations. Using the icons in the
        upper right corner of the visualisation, you can toggle between various types of infographics. The icons
        in the upper left corner allow you to generate an embed code to use the visualisation on another
        website, and to add it to your personal data collection (“basket”).</p>
