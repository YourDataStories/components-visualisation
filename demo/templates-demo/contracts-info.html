    <p class="text-justify">YourDataStories looks at TED broken down into individual “<a href="http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/#iri=http://platform.yourdatastories.eu/api/json-ld/model/owl/Contract.owl" target="_blank">Contracts</a>”. A Contract has:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a Buyer (Contracting Authority) and a Seller (Contractor),</li>
        <li>a duration or date range,</li>
        <li>a price,</li>
        <li>a CPV (Common Procurement Vocabulary) (e.g. Construction work for highways, Air-sea rescue services), a CPV Code</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: #3C75B7">A quick overview of the Dashboard</h3>

    <p class="text-justify">The two maps show all buyers and
        sellers of the selected countries that are available in the data, coloured according to the number of Contracts
        they have been involved in. Both maps are interactive, allowing the selection of any number and combination of
        countries.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">In the next step, a slider allows the selection of any time period within the available data.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">Finally, there is a set of "vertical tabs" that allow you to filter for various aspects
        of the TED data. Clicking on each "vertical tab" shows predefined visualisations. Using the icons in the
        upper right corner of the visualisation, you can toggle between various types of infographics. The icons
        in the upper left corner allow you to generate an embed code to use the visualisation on another
        website, and to add it to your personal data collection ("library").</p>
